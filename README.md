# MVC made as clear as Mud!

Like many things, Mud was born out of a specific need/want: I needed to port an app off of Google App Engine dude to *technical limitations*. Failing to get Flask or Django running smoothly on my local machine, I resorted to my ol' chap PHP.

**Mud is an attempt at mimicking Google App Engine's webapp.**

Steps to get Mud running will come soon!
